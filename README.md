A **web developer** architects and develops websites and web applications using web technologies (i.e., HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), which typically runs on the Open Web Platform or acts as compilation input for non-web platform environments (i.e., React Native).

A person enters into the field of front-end development by learning to build a website or web application which relies on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and commonly runs in a web browser but can also run in a headless browser, WebView, or as compilation input for a native runtime environment. 

**We will oosely strive to follow the process outlined below:**

- Learn, roughly, how the web platform works. Make sure we know the "what" and "where" of HTML, CSS, DOM, JavaScript, Domains, DNS, URLs, HTTP, browsers, and servers/hosting. We won't dive deep on anything just yet, we will just aim to understand the parts at play and how they loosely fit together and start by building simple web pages.

- Learn HTML

- Learn CSS

- Learn JavaScript

- Learn DOM

- Learn the fundamentals of user interface design (i.e. UI patterns, interaction design, user experience design, and usability).

- Learn CLI/command line

- Learn the practice of software engineering (i.e., Application design/architecture, templates, Git, testing, monitoring, automating, code quality, development methodologies).

- Get opinionated and customize your tool box with whatever makes sense to your brain (e.g. Webpack, React, and Mobx).

- Learn Node.js 



**Learning the actual underlying technologies, before learning abstractions.**

- Don't learn jQuery, learn the DOM.
- Don't learn SASS, learn CSS. 
- Don't learn JSX, learn HTML. 
- Don't learn TypeScript, learn JavaScript.
- Don't learn Handlebars, learn JavaScript ES6 templates.
- Don't just use Bootstrap, learn UI patterns. 


### **Potential Front-end Developer Skills.**

**The following core web technologies are employed by front-end developers:**

- Hyper Text Markup Language ( HTML)

- Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)

- Uniform Resource Locators (URLs)

- Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)

- JavaScript Programming Language (ECMAScript 262)

- JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)

- Document Object Model (DOM)

- Web APIs (aka HTML5 and friends or Browser APIs)

- Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (aka WCAG) & Accessible Rich Internet Applications (aka ARIA)
